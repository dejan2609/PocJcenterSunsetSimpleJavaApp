POC for JCenter -->> Maven Central switch
=================


Just checkout some tags and refresh project like this:

* press 'Sync Project with Gradle Files' in the upper right corner (a.k.a elephant button) AND
* execute gradle command like this: ./gradlew --refresh-dependencies

Note: these two basically should boil to a same thing (but at the moment we are hunting bugs, so we need to crosscheck as much as we could).
